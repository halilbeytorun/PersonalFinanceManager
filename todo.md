* rethink the general file structure/design
* sqlite3 supported data?
* update the tests to be more general, parametrized tests or typed test somehow would be perfect for different types and different columns!
* Implement main window, a basic design beforehand is needed.
* update unit tests, read google test stuff. Write better data base unit tests. Update DataManagementModule if necessary!
* Improve sqlite implementation on the road when there is need.

Small todos:
* provide a better way for database path
* Bacground try to put a nice background for entrance and register pages
